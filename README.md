*Send [FFXIV Lodestone](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone) news to Discord servers.*

This program scrapes the Lodestone for new news, formats it, and sends it to Discord webhooks. It is
entirely configured via an SQLite database containing the webhooks to send to. It does everything
else automatically.
